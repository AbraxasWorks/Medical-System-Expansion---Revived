[h1]Features[/h1]
Improves how the game handles prosthetics by not discarding the sub-parts of added prostheses. This makes it so adding bionic parts doesn't reduce the total health of the pawn, and the sub-parts can be damaged.
[list]
[*]Items keep track of the other prostheses they include
[*]Prosthesis parts can be damaged, and will need to be replaced when destroyed
[*]Prosthesis versions to support multiple races
[*]Modules can be added to parts to expand on their functionality (extra weapons, stat boosts...)
[/list]
This mod only adds the minimum prostheses necessary to make vanilla work with the new system, so we suggest using it together with one of the following supported mods (to be loaded [u]before[/u] MSE2):[list]
[*][url=steam://url/CommunityFilePage/1949064302]Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering - Forked[/url] (direct crafting is more balanced)

Known incompatibilities:[list]
[*][url=steam://url/CommunityFilePage/735106432]EdB Prepare Carefully[/url] and [url=steam://url/CommunityFilePage/1874644848]Character Editor[/url]: adding limb hediffs doesn't work properly
[/list]
If a mod not explicitly listed here adds limb prostheses, they will behave like vanilla (it will show a warning in the debug log after the game is loaded).
If a mod adds races with limbs that have different parts from normal humans, human prostheses will not work properly on them; if they have the same kinds of parts but in different numbers (i.e. 3 fingers instead of 5), or if they have been patched, MSE2 will generate a new limb version.
If you wish for a mod to be patched, you can request it in the Compatibility discussion below (no promises).


[h1]Adding to pre-existing saves[/h1]
The first time a game that was created without MSE2 is loaded with it, you can use the debug option labelled "Fix all prostheses in the world" to make everything work properly.
If you wish to remove this mod from a save you should first set to allow all special thing filters MSE2 introduces ("Allow complete" and "Allow incomplete" in the BodyParts category) from any storage zone and crafting bill.

This mod was inspired by [url=steam://url/CommunityFilePage/1749027802]Medical System Expansion by Oreno[/url] ([url=steam://url/CommunityFilePage/2006968859]1.1 port[/url]). They are quite different from MSE2, and at this point in development all MSE2 source code is original.
