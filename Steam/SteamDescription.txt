[h1]Features[/h1]
Improves how the game handles prosthetics by not discarding the sub-parts of added prostheses. This makes it so adding bionic parts doesn't reduce the total health of the pawn, and the sub-parts can be damaged.
[list]
[*]Items keep track of the other prostheses they include
[*]Prosthesis parts can be damaged, and will need to be replaced when destroyed
[*]Prosthesis versions to support multiple races
[*]Modules can be added to parts to expand on their functionality (extra weapons, stat boosts...)
[/list]
This mod only adds the minimum prostheses necessary to make vanilla work with the new system, so we suggest using it together with one of the following supported mods (to be loaded [u]before[/u] MSE2):[list]

[/list]
If a mod not explicitly listed here adds limb prostheses, they will behave like vanilla (it will show a warning in the debug log after the game is loaded).
If a mod adds races with limbs that have different parts from normal humans, human prostheses will not work properly on them; if they have the same kinds of parts but in different numbers (i.e. 3 fingers instead of 5), or if they have been patched, MSE2 will generate a new limb version.
If you wish for a mod to be patched, you can request it in the Compatibility discussion below (no promises).


[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[h3]What happened to my advanced bionics?[/h3]
MSE2 removes the advanced bionic tier of limbs, because they are made redundant by installing an [i]Advanced processing module[/i] on a normal bionic limb.
[h3]What modules can I install on my prosthesis?[/h3]
The description of prosthetics contains an entry indicating how many module slots it contains, as well as the list of modules that can be installed on it.
[h3]What is a segment?[/h3]
A segment is a piece of a prosthesis, for example a hand without fingers, or just the shoulder part of an arm. In the crafting menu you can find different recipes to craft both a segment or an entire limb; if you have race mods with slightly different limbs you will also find recipes for prostheses compatible with their body.
[h3]I can't install a prosthesis?!?[/h3]
Only limbs that are compatible with a pawn will be installable. You can check the entry labelled "Compatible versions" in a prosthesis's description to see what races it can be installed on, and you can use the "Add part" buttons to add the missing parts.



[h1]Adding to pre-existing saves[/h1]
You can load this mod on an existing save.
If you wish to remove this mod from a save you should first set to allow all special thing filters MSE2 introduces ("Allow complete" and "Allow incomplete" in the BodyParts category) from any storage zone and crafting bill.

[url=https://github.com/AbraxasWorks/Medical-System-Expansion---Revived]GitHub repo[/url]
[url=https://discord.gg/uFatgua95u]Discord Server[/url]
This mod was inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1749027802]Medical System Expansion by Oreno[/url] ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006968859]1.1 port[/url]). They are quite different from MSE2, and at this point in development all MSE2 source code is original.
