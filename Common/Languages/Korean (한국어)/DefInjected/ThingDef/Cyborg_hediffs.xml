	<ANN_EnergyFist.description>(Replacement) A combat-oriented hand replacement consisting of a technological hand and an implemented pumping system inside the wrist. It is furious in combat, and its mighty mini-servos can crush a skull like a natural hand crushes an egg. The mechanical trigger lets you have control about its sheer power with its poweful speed boosts bounded on neural connectors and energized by a vanometric micro-battery.</ANN_EnergyFist.description>
