	<description>&lt;b&gt;Not Just Another Prostheses Mod&lt;/b&gt;. An expansion of vanilla medical system and how they work. Adds full featured prosthesis that uses vanilla standard and integration with another mod.


&lt;b&gt;&lt;size=18&gt;Main Features&lt;/size&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
- Installed prosthesis can keep its child parts. In vanilla or other mod, if you install prosthesis part like peg leg then you lost its foot and toe.
- Exclusive body part system framework and it's modules. This allows you to install prosthetic modules on installed prosthesis.
&lt;b&gt;This two main features only work on bionic and archotech body parts&lt;/b&gt;. It doesn't make sense to me for basic and simple body parts can have this features.

- New organ transplant rejection, prosthesis limb and bone adaptation system, and implant complication. Some of this is never done by another mod.
This mod not really that OP. &lt;b&gt;Raider chance to spawn with prostheses parts and implants now higher and also have same part system feature&lt;/b&gt;.

- New exclusive implant system framework. Now you can install implant on installed prosthesis part. of course there's a limit of how many implant can be installed on installed prosthesis part.

&lt;b&gt;Other Features&lt;/b&gt;
- Add new research projects.
- 2 new workbenches.
- About 50+ new prostheses parts and implants.
- Balancing vanilla prostheses body parts and implants.
- Adds prostheses parts and implants to trader and raider.
- Vanilla organs can be harvested and transplanted.
- Harvested organs can rot and decay.
- Now all bones can be destroyed by damage or attack.
- And many other features.
