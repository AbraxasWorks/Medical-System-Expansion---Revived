# Medical System Expansion 2

A mod to balance and bring more depth to the RimWorld prosthetic mechanics. It fixes the issues of limb prostheses reducing the total hp of pawns, and of making their sub-parts unable to use clothing. It introduces a module system, allowing prostheses to be upgraded with extra weapons or modifications.

## Main Features
- Prevents installed prostheses from throwing away and ignoring their sub-parts, meaning they are simulated and can be damaged or destroyed.
- Makes prostheses in item form keep track of all the sub-parts that they include and that will be installed with them, based on the selected configuration.
- Introduces a module system, which allows prostheses with module slots to be upgraded with weapons or other modifications.



## Mod Compatibility
This mod is meant to be highly compatible with other mods. It supports the main prosthetic mods (EPOE, EPOE-F, Rahs), and a decent number of others.
Different races should work by generating new prosthetic limb versions.
Unpatched limb prostheses should automatically work like in vanilla.

Elite Bionics Framework and one of the main prosthetic mods are recommended.

## Installation and uninstallation
MSE2 can be added to existing saves, as long as you execute the debug command labelled "Fix all prostheses in the world" the first time a prexisting game is loaded with the mod.

Uninstallation should be mostly fine. In the case of weird glitches, try resetting (clicking Allow all) the filters of storage zones and crafting bills where MSE2 SpecialThingFilters ("Allow complete" and "Allow incomplete" in the BodyParts category) were set to disallow.

## Other information
This mod was inspired by Oreno's Medical System Expansion. MSE2's source is now all original.
