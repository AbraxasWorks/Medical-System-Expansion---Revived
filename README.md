# Medical System Expansion
**Not Just Another Prostheses Mod.** An expansion of vanilla medical system and how they work. Adds full featured prosthesis that uses vanilla standard and integration with another mod.

## Main Features
- Installed prosthesis can keep its child parts. In vanilla or other mod, if you install prosthesis part like peg leg then you lost its foot and toe.
- Exclusive body part system framework and it's modules. This allows you to install prosthetic modules on installed prosthesis.

**Note that above two main features only work on bionic and archotech prosthesis.** It's not make sense to me if basic and simple body parts can have this features.

- New organ transplant rejection, prosthesis limb and bone adaptation system, and implant complication. Some of this is never done by another mod.

This mod not really that OP. **Raider chance to spawn with prostheses parts and implants now higher and also have same feature.**

- Exclusive implant system framework. Prosthesis part that support this can install implant on installed prosthesis part. of course there's a limit of how many implant can be installed on installed prosthesis part.
- Fixed vanilla bug where installed basic or simple prosthetic parts can naturally heal. Now you don't get your installed hook hand naturally healed.
